    "- Once you are able to get a Jetstream allocation and log in, please create at least an m3.medium instance with 8 CPUS and 30GB memory to run the notebooks. You can find more details about that [here](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/getting-started/first-instance/#give-your-instance-a-name). We recommend that you enable the 'Web Desktop' option in your cloud instance."

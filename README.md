# OSDF_Examples

## About
Contains Jupyter notebook workflows which access climate data from various [OSDF](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf.html) origins using [PelicanFS](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelicanfs). The examples include workflows where computations are executed on various platforms like NCAR's Casper, TACC's Stampede3 and cloud computing platforms like Jetstream2. If you use any workflow in this repository, please cite using [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.16863133.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16863133)


## Example Workflows
1) Access CESM2 LENS data from the AWS opendata origin and the NCAR data origin and
   - a) [Benchmark](notebooks/ndc_workflows/aws_benchmark.ipynb) data access speeds for subsets of various sizes.
   - b) [Bias-correct](notebooks/cesm_bias.ipynb) surface temperature using ERA5 reanalysis. 
   - c) [Compute](notebooks/cesm_oceanheat.ipynb) surface ocean heat content.
   - d) [Compute](notebooks/cesm_gmst_ncar.ipynb) GMST anomaly and plot.
2) Access NOAA SONAR data from the AWS origin to [plot echograms](notebooks/ndc_workflows/sonar_ai.ipynb)
3) Acesss Sentinel-2 satellite data from AWS to [compute spectral change](notebooks/ndc_workflows/pycogss_spectral_change.ipynb)
4) Access NA-CORDEX data from NCAR's Geoscience Data Exchange (GDEX) and make some diagnostic [plots](notebooks/na_cordex.ipynb)
5) Access CONUS 404 data from NCAR's GDEX and make some diagnostic [plots](notebooks/conus404.ipynb)
6) Access data from the `SAAG' dataset hosted on NCAR's GDEX and make diagnostic [plots](notebooks/saag.ipynb)
7) Benchmark data access speeds from the NCAR data [origin](notebooks/ndc_workflows/ncar_benchmark.ipynb) using the DART reanalysis dataset and make [diagnostic plots](notebooks/dart-cam6.ipynb)
8) Benchmark data access speeds from the NCAR's data [origin](notebooks/ndc_workflows/ncar_benchmark_ap40.ipynb), when the data is accessed from the OSPool's access point AP40
9) Run temperature bias-correction workflow on
   - a) [Stampede3](notebooks/cesm_osdf_stampede3.ipynb)
   - b) [NCAR's Casper](notebooks/cesm_posix_bias.ipynb)
10) [Compute](notebooks/geocat_climatology.ipynb) climatological average of daily temperature data using the [geocat-comp](https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/climatology_average.html) package
11) Access CMIP6 zarr data from (> 27 Global Climate Models) AWS and
    - a) plot the evolution of [Global Mean Surface Temperature](notebooks/cmip6_aws_zarr.ipynb) with time. The model projections were also compared with the [HadCRUT5](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/) observational dataset.
    - b) compute [Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity](notebooks/cmip6_ecs.ipynb).

### Machine learning workflows
1) Use logistic regression to [predict](notebooks/ml_workflows/nino3.4_index.ipynb) Nino3.4 indices in advance. The training data are Sea Surface Temperature values and observed nino indices hosted on NCAR's GDEX.
